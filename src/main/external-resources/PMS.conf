# ============================================================================
# Configuration file for PMS
# ============================================================================
# Introduction:
#
# This "PMS.conf" file holds the configuration settings for PMS. These settings
# are usually set using the PMS graphical user interface. If you are running
# PMS on a headless system, you may not be able to kick off the GUI; instead,
# you can edit the PMS.conf file to control the operation of PMS. A restart of
# PMS is required after editing this file.
#
# Commenting out an option or leaving it empty forces the PMS default
# that is indicated.
#
# Key value pairs
# ---------------
# The configuration file contains key/value pairs separated by an equals (=)
# sign; the key on the left and the value on the right. The value is edited in
# this file or set using the PMS GUI and saved. The value can take a number of
# different forms:
#
#  - toggle: a checkbox or boolean; either "true" or "false"
#  - selector: a dropdown menu in the GUI, generating a string or numeric
#              value. Available options will usually be stated below
#  - string: a short text or a number
#  - text: a longer text with embedded line breaks
#  - list: a comma-separated list of strings or numbers
#
# In the file below the value type is shown after the GUI option label.

# Profile Name
# --------------
# An optional identifier used to distinguish this profile (i.e. collection of
# settings) from other profiles. The profile name is displayed in the renderer
# in square brackets after the software name e.g.
#

#
# See the FAQ for details on how to create and use multiple profiles:

# ---------
# GUI Option: Force networking on interface (selector)
# Specifies the (physical) network interface to attach to, should only be
# relevant when the server has more than one network interface and PMS picks

network_interface =

# Specifies a comma separated list of network interfaces to ignore when
# scanning for a suitable network interface to attach to. This is typically
# used to ignore virtual interfaces created by other applications.

renderer_default =

# GUI Option: Force default renderer (disable automatic detection) (toggle)
# By default PMS tries to automatically detect what renderers try to connect to
# it. When this is true, PMS will assume any renderer that connects is the
# default renderer.
# Default: false
renderer_force_default =

# Set the string that contains a list of IP adresses and the renderer
# profiles that should be forced to match for them. The comma separated
# list contains pairs of a renderer name followed by "@" and an IP
# address. The renderer name should match the value of the RendererName
# property in a .conf file. The IP address can be specified as a range.
# If there are multiple matches, the first that is found will be forced.
#
# Example: "Sony Bravia HX@192.168.1.34,Sony Bravia EX@192.168.0-1.*" will
# use regular detection for a renderer connecting from "192.168.2.1" (as
# there is no match), will force "Sony Bravia EX" for a renderer connecting
# from "192.168.1.2" (match with the range) and will force "Sony Bravia HX"
# for a renderer connecting from "192.168.1.34" (matches both entries, but
# the HX was found first).

# Filename templates
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# File display names are constructed by substituting variables
# into the filename_format_short or filename_format_long templates. The
# former is used for files in the #--TRANSCODE--# folder and the latter
# is used for all other files and folders.
#
# The available variables are:
#
#     aCodec  - audio codec (e.g. "AC3")
#     aFlavor - audio flavor (e.g. "ac3 5.1 @ 640 kbps")
#     aFull   - audio language full name (e.g. "Japanese")
#     aLabel  - the localised version of "Audio"
#     aShort  - audio language short name (e.g. "jp")
#     dvdLen  - DVD track duration (e.g. "3:27:15")
#     eFull   - engine full name (e.g. "FFmpeg Web Video")
#     eShort  - engine short name (e.g. "FFWV")
#     fFull   - file name with extension (e.g. "Big Buck Bunny.mov")
#     fShort  - file name without extension (e.g. "Big Buck Bunny")
#     isVTS   - true if the resource is a DVD VIDEO_TS folder
#     sExt    - set to the localised version of "External Subtitles" if the file has external subtitles
#     sFlavor - subtitle flavor (e.g. "TX3G")
#     sFull   - subtitle language full name (e.g. "English")
#     sLabel  - the localised version of "Sub"
#     sShort  - subtitle language short name (e.g. "en")
#     sType   - subtitle type (e.g. "Timed text")
#     vtsDVD  - the name of the parent folder of the VIDEO_TS folder
#
#
# In addition, the following variables are available:
#
#     extra    - True if any of the following variables are set: dvdLen, eFull, eShort, sExt, sType
#     isFile   - True if the resource is a file
#     isFolder - True if the resource is a folder
#     lt, gt   - "<" and ">". Use these to avoid conflicts with the start and end tags
#
# Note that variables may not always be defined e.g. the filename (fShort and fFull) is not
# set inside the #--TRANSCODE--# folder and audio and subtitle variables are not
# set for folders or other files without audio or subtitle tracks.
#
# The template engine, JMTE, supports simple conditional statements e.g.:
#
#     <if aCodec> ... <end>
#
# In addition, it provides a shorthand syntax that allows the following:
#
#     <if foo> PREFIX<foo>SUFFIX <end>
#
# to be written as:
#
#     <PREFIX,foo,SUFFIX>
#
# e.g.:
#
#     <[,eFull,]>
#
# displays the engine name wrapped in square brackets if the engine is defined, or an empty string if it isn't.
# See the JMTE documentation for more details: https://jmte.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html
#
# After substitution, multiple spaces are squashed to a single space and leading or trailing
# whitespace is removed.

# The filename template to use for files in the #--TRANSCODE--# folder.
# Default: "<[,eFull,]> <if aCodec> {<aLabel>: <aCodec>/<aFull>< (,aFlavor,)>} <end> <if sType> {<sLabel>: <sType>/<sFull>< (,sFlavor,)>} <end>"
filename_format_short =

# The filename template to use for files and folders outside the #--TRANSCODE--# folder.
# Default: "<fFull> <if isVTS>< {,vtsDVD,}><end> <if extra> - <end> <dvdLen> <[,eFull,]> <{,sExt,}> <if sType> {<sLabel>: <sType>/<sFull>< (,sFlavor,)>} <end>"
