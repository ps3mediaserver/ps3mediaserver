This directory contains the renderer configuration profiles for all devices that
PS3 Media Server supports. Every configuration profile serves two purposes:

  - Allow PMS to recognize a specific renderer when it tries to connect
  - Define the possibilities of that renderer

For a detailed description of all available options in a configuration file,
examine "PS3.conf".
