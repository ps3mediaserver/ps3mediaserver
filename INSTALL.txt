To install PMS from the tarball on Linux etc. (these instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 12.04,
but something similar should work on most Unix distributions), open a terminal and enter the
following commands (replace <version> with the version you're downloading/using e.g. 1.80.0):

1) Install the dependencies (this only needs to be done once):

    sudo apt-get install ffmpeg mediainfo mencoder openjdk-7-jre
    # you can also optionally install dcraw and vlc: sudo apt-get install dcraw vlc

2) Download the tarball e.g.:

    # if wget isn't installed, run: sudo apt-get install wget
    wget https://ps3mediaserver.googlecode.com/files/pms-generic-linux-unix-<version>.tgz

3) Extract the tarball into a pms-<version> directory:

    tar xzvf pms-<version>-generic-linux-unix.tar.gz

4) Run (note: PMS should NOT be run as root):

    cd pms-<version>
    ./PMS.sh

PMS accesses some files in the pms-<version> directory (the working directory).
