Java PS3 Media Server for Windows
=================================
by shagrath

Hi there... you will find on this page an experimental upnp media server I've written in Java
(so you can also use it on Linux), with precious help from MPlayer/MEncoder, FFMpeg,
AVISynth eventually, and currently using with my Playstation3.... I was quite fed up with TVersity
and others servers I've tried as none of them easily supports subtitles and 1080p transcode,
as well as any kind of files I want to play without worrying about ps3 compatibility.
I'm currently transcoding in real-time and no quality loss, 1080p mkv files.
The drawback is the high bitrate your network must support: with the default settings,
specific scenes with a lot of details (e.g.: zoom on a newspaper article) can have
bitrates near 100mb/s, so gigabit is maybe useful.
However, you can limit the bitrate, for wireless 720p playback for example. Check The FAQ !


Current features
================

Ready to launch and play. No codec packs to install. No folder configuration and pre-parsing or this kind of annoying thing. All your folders are directly browsed by the PS3, there's an automatic refresh also.
Real-time video transcoding via MEncoder, tsMuxer or Avisynth
DVD ISOs images / VIDEO_TS Folder transcoder
OGG/FLAC/MPC/APE audio transcoding
Thumbnail generation for Videos
You can choose with a virtual folder system your audio/subtitle language on the PS3!
All formats PS3 natively supports: MP3/WMA, JPG/PNG/GIF/TIFF, and all kind of videos (AVI, MP4, TS, M2TS, MPEG) the ps3 is willing to play
Display camera RAWs thumbnails (Canon / Nikon, etc.)
ZIP/RAR files as browsable folders for pictures/audio files
Support for pictures based feeds, such as Flickr and Picasaweb
Internet TV / Web Radio support with VLC, MEncoder or MPlayer
Podcasts audio/ Video feeds support

Windows/Linux Only:

Lossless 5.1 PCM transcoding with DTS movies
Remux video and remux/reencode all audio tracks to AC3/PCM in real time with tsMuxer
FLAC 96kHz/24bits/5.1 support



Requirements
============

A core 2 duo CPU (mine is a E6750, 2.66GHz) for smooth 1080p transcoding, but 720p seems to be transcodable with a good P4 :p


Installation
============

- Get a Java Runtime Environment: http://www.java.com. JRE version 6 is a minimum.
- Launch PMS.exe (PMS.sh on Linux).
- If the server is not detected by the PS3 (this can happens if you have several network interfaces),
check the traces firs, and try setting a correct IP address in the "General Configuration" Tab, and restart the application


Transcoding on Windows: HOWTO
=============================

2 possible methods:

A) Using the server "as is": Nothing else to install, it will use Mencoder for the transcoding part.

It's the recommended way, cause you do not have to mess with your system / codec pack / etc.
You will also be able to mux on the fly without reencoding

B) Using Avisynth/FFDshow. Paired with CoreAVC, it's quite efficient with multi cores.
1- If not already done, get and install a codec pack with ffdshow (VSfilter must be included for subtitles).
   My favorite is CCCP Codec Pack [http://www.cccp-project.net/download.php?type=cccp]
2- Get and install AVISynth 2.5.7 (I've met some framerate problems with 2.5.8 betas)
   [http://downloads.sourceforge.net/avisynth2/Avisynth_257.exe?modtime=1168199840&big_mirror=0]
3- Set up the FFDShow Audio Mixer to 5.1 (3/0/2 LFE)
4- Set "Autoload VS Filter" to true
5- Configure Haali Splitter (audio/subtitles language priorities)

Optional Codecs: CoreAVC is a good choice for H264 decoding, Quicktime Alternative and Real Alternative are also useful
(Apple 1080p trailers for example).


Transcoding on Linux: HOWTO
===========================

You just need to have mplayer, mencoder and ffmpeg binaries on your path (the more recent, the better).


Transcoding on OSX: HOWTO
=========================

Like Windows, you just use the server "as is": Nothing else to install, it will use Mencoder for the transcoding part.


Usage
=====

Navigation/Transcode
--------------------

By default, wmv, avi, mpg/ts/m2ts files are streamable, except in case of srt/sub file present with the same file name.
All videos can be transcoded, as each streamable video appears once into its folder, and once into
a special folder "#Transcoded#" present in each sub folder, with different options (audio/subtitles/other transcoding tools maybe)
so you can choose what's working best on ps3. For the audio part, only ogg, flac, mpc audio files and such can be transcoded:
You can however force or skip transcode for specific file extensions (check the transcode settings panel)


Custom cover art
----------------

Just drop an image in the same folder as your movie file (jpeg or png) called <mymovie>.jpg (or .png) /
also supported:  <mymovie>.cover.jpg (or .png). For example, for a movie called 'tokyo.mkv',
the cover file can be named 'tokyo.png' or 'tokyo.mkv.cover.png'

In order to apply the same image to all videos, just drop a folder.jpg file in this directory.


Transcoding engine prioritization by folder
-------------------------------------------

If you have some movies who plays well with the tsMuxer engine, and nonetheless want
mencoder as your default engine, you can add [tsmuxer] at the end of this folder.
The tsmuxer engine will be the first suggested, either as a replacement for your non ps3 compatible video,
or on the top of the list proposed in the #Transcoded# folder. 

Available engine names:

Mencoder = [mencoder]
AviSynth/Mencoder = [avsmencoder]
AviSynth/FFmpeg = [avsffmpeg]
tsMuxer= [tsmuxer]

It's also working the same way for virtual based folders, such as web folders names (see WEB.CONF)
See the following web streaming engines:

MPlayer audio streaming = [mplayerwebaudio]
VideoLan audio streaming = [vclaudio]
MEncoder video streaming = [mencoderwebvideo]
VideoLan video streaming = [vclvideo]
Mplayer stream dump = [mplayervideodump]



Known issues:
=============

- Seek to specific time is OK, but fast forward/fast rewind is not very reactive, especially with Avisynth transcoding (depends of the machine)


Thanks
